// This is where all of the JavaScript code is handled for your theme.
//
// We recommend you break your JavaScript into multiple files and put them in a separate
// directory. We've used a "javascripts" directory in our example below. After that we'll use
// Sprockets (getsprockets.org) to package them into one file. Sprockets also allows you to
// use CoffeeScript (coffeescript.org) by ending your file name with .coffee.
//
// However, if you don't have much JavaScript, or you're just a glutton for punishment,
// you could simply put all of your JavaScript in this file. It's up to you.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Here we're including example files: example_1 is standard JavaScript, example_2 is CoffeeScript
//= require javascripts/example_1
//= require javascripts/example_2
