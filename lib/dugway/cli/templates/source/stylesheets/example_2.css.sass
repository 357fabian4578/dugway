// This shows how you can use Sass in your theme. However, there are a few limitations to be aware of:
// * Theme variables like {{ theme.font_color }} won't work with the Sass's color methods,
//   since they're not real colors yet
// * Sass will strip out blocks like {% if something %} or {% case something %}

$secondaryColor: #999999

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
  color: darken($secondaryColor, 25%)
  font-family: {{ theme.header_font | font_family }}
